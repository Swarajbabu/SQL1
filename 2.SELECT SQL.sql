-- to select all the data from the table
select * from student;

-- if we want to see the only 3 columens of data
select rollno,name,grade from student;

-- to select data with condition we called where clause
select * from student where city="Delhi";

-- to select data with condition on marks we called where clause
select * from student where marks>80;

-- to select data with multiple conditions we use AND , OR operators
select * from student where marks>=85 and city="Mumbai";

-- to select data with distinct values or unigue values 
select distinct city from student; -- it will give only unique city names
--output
-- Pune
-- Mumbai
-- Delhi


-- Arithmetic Operators: + (add), - (subtract), * (multiply), / (divide), % (modulus)
-- Comparison Operators: =, !=, >, <, >=, <=
